## @tools/cli ✨✨

🍙 It is used to simplify the installation and configuration of tools when creating a new project, such as `eslint`, `git hooks`, which is similar to the way that [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) can save you from [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) configuration.

### Geting Started 🐠
Install to global to use tools.

```bash
yarn
yarn build
yarn global add #Global install
clis --version
```

### Usage 🚀
View all commands.

```bash
clis -h
```
New umi based project.
